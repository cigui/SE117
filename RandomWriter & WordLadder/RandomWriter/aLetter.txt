All my friends have gone away
I need myself to sing this song
But you always passed away.
But It seems to be o.k.
All my wish and powers
They would take me to the gate
Should I really find my problem?
Do I really want to know about?
I m writing a letter for me
Is there anything I would say?
I dont have to throw my life away
Everything goes wrong to turn into the way of life
This could take so long to find the way
All those people cry in vain
Now I see the light in pain
I can find the way of love
You dont have to throw your life away
Everything goes wrong to turn into the way of life
This could take so long to find the way
All those people cry in vain
Now you see the light in pain
You can find the way of love
All my friends have gone away
I need myself to sing this song
But you always passed away.
But It seems to be o.k.
All my wish and powers
They would take me to the gate
Should I really find my problem?
Do I really want to know about?
Im writing a letter for me
Is there anything I would say?
Say good bye into the perfect sky
But its your love can be the real life line
